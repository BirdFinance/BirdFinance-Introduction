## Introduction

1. Project name: Bird Finance
2. Slogan: Fly with Bird
3. Project Introduction

 Bird Finance is a DeFi financial platform focusing on smart pool lending. Through the best strategy formula, we are constantly looking for safe, stable and high-yield projects in the blockchain world and use the automatic compound mining strategy to help users efficiently and automatically realize the appreciation of digital assets.

At the same time, Bird Finance implements extreme deflation mechanism. Through smart contract, transaction circulation automatically charges 6% of the fee. 2% is used to add liquidity, 2% is bonus for all token holding addresses, and 2% is put into the governance pool. It helps users to make compound profits. At the same time, it continues to buy back BIRD with platform income to achieve continuous deflation and value growth.

Thanks to the strong technical team of BIRD, Bird Finance uses cross chain technology to realize cross-chain intercommunication of BIRD. Initially, BIRD is issued on BSC and HECO Chain. After that, Ethereum and OKExChain will be supported. It will make no limitations for exchanging on different chains.

## Advantages
### The World's First Extreme Deflation Smart Pool DeFi Protocol

1. Service fee of smart pool mining is used to buyback BIRD
2. Governance token BIRD with deflation model. Redistribution through circulation and automatic deflation through circulation
3. Service fee of liquidity mining buy-back  

### One Token with 4 Mining Ways

1. Pledge the principal in one time and automatically carry out compound interest mining to obtain certificate tokens
2. Pledge certificate tokens in the liquidity pool to obtain BIRD
3. Pledge certificate tokens for a period of time to draw NFT cards
4. Pledge BIRD to obtain BIRD


### High Degree of Community Autonomy            

1. The access of smart pools to mining pools is decided by community voting 
2. The future development direction and major issues of Bird Finance are completely decided by the community and implemented through the community voting
3. 2% circulation tax of BIRD is directly put into the DAO pool to encourage the community to participate in governance 


### Lending Smart Pool

1. The smart pool has its own lending function, and some tokens are reserved for lending 
2. When the market risk turns higher, the proportion of mining funds will be reduced and the proportion of lending funds will be increased
3. When the market is good, the proportion of lending funds will be reduced and the proportion of mining funds will be increased

### Cross-chain Smart Pool

In the future, it will be connected to HECO, OKExChain, Ethereum. The smart pool will automatically cross chain to find high-quality mining pools, thus providing higher cross-chain combination income
